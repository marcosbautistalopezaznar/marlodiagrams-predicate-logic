# Instructions for Marlo Diagrams for Predicate Logic

Marlo Diagrams allow for an intuitive and innovative representation of the formal structure of propositions that can be translated into predicate logic with a particular or universal quantifier. In this way, we represent in a single diagram simple sentences like "All men are mortal" or complex ones like "Among the Greeks there are artists, scientists, and discoverers, and only among them are there philosophers who are cynics." To express a proposition, first write a formula in the subject. You can use simple literals like "m" or "¬m" to generate terms like "mammals" and "non-mammals". You can also combine these literals in the subject by their conjunction, for example to refer to "mammals that are not primates" as "m¬p", and you can create disjunctions like "¬m/of" to refer to those who "are not mammals or are oviparous and fly".

Once the subject is created, write a predicate or list of predicates separated by commas in the IN region. If you write "p, ¬q/r, sc" you are saying that there are only three classes of subject, which in this case do not exclude each other, because it would not be contradictory to combine them, so it is even likely that there are subjects that are "psc" or "p¬q". When you want to express that your knowledge is particular and that there may be other classes of subject in addition to those you explicitly mention, write the "?" sign in the IN predicate list. Thus, if you write "m,?" you are saying that within the subject there are beings that have the quality "m", but there may be others who do not have it. You can also write "?" as the only predicate.

Finally, write in the OUT region the list of predicates that can occur outside the subject. For example, imagine you want to represent that "all mammals are vertebrates and only among them are humans". First write "m" in the subject, then "v,vh" in IN. Now you have to decide if you add in OUT, that is, outside the set of mammals, beings that can be vertebrates and beings that can be humans. In this case and according to your proposition, you should write "v" in OUT to indicate that it is possible that there are non-mammalian vertebrates, but you should not write "h" in OUT because it is not possible in your statement that there are non-mammalian humans. Keep in mind that in this version only the predicates in OUT that are also in IN affect the creation of formulas.

Finally, note that the "/" sign in the subject area and the IN predicates translates into an inclusive disjunction, while in the OUT area it is interpreted as a NAND logic gate, so if you write "c/d" in OUT, "c/d?" will appear on the side of the diagram to indicate that outside the subject the conjunction of "c" and "d" cannot occur, as when we affirm that only among humans are there featherless beings that speak.

Enter the subject, inputs, and outputs in the corresponding fields.
Click on the "Generate Diagram" button.
If the inputs are valid, a Marlo Diagram will be generated that represents the relationships between the subject, inputs, and outputs.
The diagram will then be displayed on the page, and the logical formulas generated based on the specified inputs and outputs will be provided.
Have fun exploring different combinations of inputs and outputs to generate your own Marlo Diagrams!.
